      Beauty School’s formation built from modest intentions, from stalwarts within the Leeds music scene, lyricist Joe
      Cabrera alongside guitarist Dan Shaw started Beauty School as the result of unfinished business and new things to
      say. With the introduction of bassist Liam Craig, guitarist Jordan Hill and drummer Charlie Thomas, Beauty School
      fully formed. Alongside the band’s signing with Slam Dunk Records, Beauty School are set to release their debut
      full-length record in early 2022; looking to fuse diverse, wide-ranging influences into what will essentially be,
      sad boomer anthems - buckle up.

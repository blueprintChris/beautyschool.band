  'Beauty School are a 5-piece that fuse a diverse pool of influences to make eloquent emo-infused alternative-rock. Formed out of a number of members of Leeds bands with unfinished business, the band’s debut album ‘Happiness’ is an example of a group drawing from multiple areas of inspiration and experiences to make an album bursting with pent-up energy, interlaced with the deft lyrical touch of lead singer Joe Cabrera. Produced by James Kenosha (Dinosaur Pile-Up / Pulled Apart by Horses) Beauty school have interpreted sounds from pop-punk, alt-rock, and indie-rock and forged a record that finds a home in each genre without feeling out of place or over-indulgent. Having sold out their debut Leeds headline show in August 2021 the band will release ‘Happiness’ to the world via Slam Dunk Records in September 2022.';
